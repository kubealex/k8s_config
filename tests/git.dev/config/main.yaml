# Set the load order for variables and configuration.
# The paths listed here will be searched for variables files which begin with
# extensions .yaml, .yml, and .json which do not begin with a '.'.
# Additionally, the sub-directories 'files' and 'templates' are added to the
# ansible files and template search paths respectively.
#
# In this example we show using a custom variable, `k8s_config_environment_level`
# to allow the playbook which loads this configuration to provide a variable for
# the config path.
